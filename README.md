**Ecoleta - NextLevel Week**

In this first edition, the Ecoleta project was developed, which serves to manage the garbage collection process in cities. With it, you can help people find collection points more efficiently.

The project was taught by Diego Schell Fernandes, Mayk Brito and the Rocketseat staff.

Technologies such as JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Node.js, Express, NunJucks, SQLite and also IBGE's APIS were used to consume data from the States and Cities of Brazil.
